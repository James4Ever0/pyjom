# [2.0.0](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/compare/v2.0.0-rc.2...v2.0.0) (2021-06-24)

2.0.0 brings support for RxJS v7, newer TypeScript support, and a few bug fixes (see previous pre-releases.) Of note is BREAKING CHANGE that `action$.ofType()` has been removed in favor of a pipeable operator you can import `import { ofType } from 'redux-observable';`

### Bug Fixes

* **dependencies:** rxjs and tslib are now listed as dependencies ([#748](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/748)) ([e1580d7](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/e1580d7))

### Bug Fixes

* **types:** Type system now requires ofType operator to have at least one action type passed in, fixes [#689](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/689) ([#690](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/690)) ([72182ec](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/72182ec))


### Features

* **ofType:** Add warning for nullsy typescloses [#607](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/607) ([ecf3f21](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/ecf3f21))
* **rxjs7:** add rxjs 7 compatibility ([a4932a1](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/a4932a1)), closes [#735](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/735)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **rxjs7:** Uses typescript 4.2.2 and tslib 2.1.0 (same libs as rxjs 7). @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and @typescript-eslint/parser has been updated to 4.22.0 to run linter properly with new ts version, new troublesome linter rules added.

* **ofType:** Type inference for ofType, removal of ActionsObservable in favor of just Observable ([#681](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/681)) ([16f083d](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/16f083d))


* Convert project to Typescript and add es2015 build target (#672) ([ba4699e](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/ba4699e)), closes [#672](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/672)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ofType:** ActionsObservable existed so we could provide an ofType() method to the prototype of action$, before RxJS had pipeable operators. Now that pipeable operators have been out for quite some time we are removing ActionsObservable in favor or using the pipeable ofType() instead.

```js
// BEFORE
function someEpic(action$) {
  return action$
    .ofType('PING')
    .mapTo({ type: 'PONG' });
}

// AFTER
import { ofType } from 'redux-observable';
import { mapTo } from 'rxjs/operators';
function someEpic(action$) {
  return action$.pipe(
    ofType('PING')
    mapTo({ type: 'PONG' })
  );
}
```
* the TS type definition for `combineEpics()` no longer accepts any unsafe overloads. Cast to `any` if you need to provide unsafe/untyped Epics.

### Features

* **adapters:** remove adapters support ([87a5f86](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/87a5f86))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **adapters:** Support for adapters has been removed. Adapters were previously used to transform the `action$` Observable into some other stream-library primitive; like Most.js, Bacon, RxJS v4, etc. While rarely used, if you would like this functionality the MIGRATION.md guide gives an example: https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html#setting-up-the-middleware

### Bug Fixes

* **state$:** initial state is no longer skipped by state$ ([2509605](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/2509605))


### Features

* **rootEpic:** an error is now thrown if you provide your root Epic directly to . See 'https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html#setting-up-the-middleware' ([4479ac8](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/4479ac8))
* **state$:** remove previously deprecated store.dispatch/getState() from epics (NOT from your UI code) ([b352a98](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/b352a98))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **state$:** previously the second argument to your epics was a "lite" version of the redux store with store.dispatch() and store.getState(), however this has been replaced with a stream of a state$ in v1.0.0 of redux-observable and the old methods were deprecated with warnings in previous alpha versions. This release removes them entirely. See https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html

### Features

* **combineEpics:** verbose combineEpics returned function name ([#480](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/480)) ([816a916](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/816a916))
* **createEpicMiddleware:** schedule emitted actions and epic subscription on the queueScheduler, so that epic order matters less ([d3516bf](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/d3516bf))

* **state$:** state$ now only emits subsequent values if the state shallowly is different (e.g. prevValue !== nextValue). It still emits the current state immediately on subscribe regardless, as it did before, similar to BehaviorSubject. Closes [#497](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/497) ([4697047](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/4697047))
* **typings:** Make output actions optional ([34a9e12](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/34a9e12))
* **typings:** Output actions should extend input actions. ([d109077](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/d109077))
* **typings:** Updating typings for more common use-cases. ([0b0efc0](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/0b0efc0)), closes [#446](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/446)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **redux:** redux-observable now requires redux v4. The new version of redux is mostly the same, however it required us to change the `createEpicMiddleware` API. See https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html
* **createEpicMiddleware:** You must now provide your rootEpic to `epicMiddleware.run(rootEpic)` instead of passing it to `createEpicMiddleware`. This fixes issues with redux v4 where it's no longer allowed to dispatch actions while middleware is still being setup. See https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html
* **createEpicMiddleware:** `epicMiddleware.replaceEpic` has been removed. A the equivilant behavior can be accomplished by dispatching your own `END` action that your rootEpic is listening for with a `takeUntil`, then providing the next rootEpic to `epicMiddleware.run(nextRootEpic)`. See https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html
* **createEpicMiddleware:** Actions your epics emit are now scheduled using the queueScheduler. This is a bit hard to explain (and understand) but as the name suggests, a queue is used. If the queue is empty, the action is emitted as usual, but if that action causes other actions to be emitted they will be queued up until the call stack of the first action returns. In a large majority of cases this will have no perceivable impact, but it may affect the order of any complex epic-to-epic communication you have. The benefit is that actions which are emitted by an epic on start up are not missed by epics which come after it. e.g. With `combineEpics(epic1, epic2)` previously if epic1 emitted on startup, epic2 would not receive that action because it had not yet been set up. See https://redux-observable.js.org/MIGRATION.html

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **errors:** For 0.19.0 errors from reducers are no longer caught and console.error logged, instead they are just rethrown as before. This was a temporary workaround for a bug in rxjs where it would silently swallow errors. That bug has been fixed in 5.5.6+, so it is highly recommended you use _at least_ rxjs@5.5.6+ with this version of redux-observable. However, redux-observable is close to reaching 1.0.0-final which will require rxjs v6 and redux v4, if you'd like to start upgrading to it now you can use redux-observable@next (as of this writing 1.0.0-beta.1)

### Bug Fixes

* **types:** Add type for EPIC_END action type ([#272](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/272)) ([5e98f2e](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/5e98f2e)), closes [#271](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/271)


### Features

* **epics:** calling `store.dispatch()` directly inside your epics is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.0.0 ([#346](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/346) [a1ba6a2](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/a1ba6a2), [#336](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/336) [76ecd33](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/76ecd33))

The ability to call `store.dispatch()` inside your Epics was originally provided as an escape hatch, to be used rarely, if ever. Unfortunately in practice we've seen a large number of people using it extensively; there has even been popular tutorials teaching it as how you use redux-observable. Instead, Epics should emit actions through the Observable the Epic returns, using idiomatic RxJS.

#### Before

```js
const somethingEpic = (action$, store) =>
  action$.ofType(SOMETHING)
    .switchMap(() =>
      ajax('/something')
        .do(() => store.dispatch({ type: SOMETHING_ELSE }))
        .map(response => ({ type: SUCCESS, response }))
    );
```

#### After

```js
const somethingEpic = action$ =>
  action$.ofType(SOMETHING)
    .switchMap(() =>
      ajax('/something')
        .mergeMap(response => Observable.of(
          { type: SOMETHING_ELSE },
          { type: SUCCESS, response }
        ))
    );
```

`store.dispatch` will be removed from Epics in v1.0.0 of redux-observable. This is unrelated to usage of `store.dispatch` inside your UI components--you will continue to use it there

* **ofType:** Better support for redux-actions ([#348](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/348)) ([c4d0ccf](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/c4d0ccf))
* **ofType:** expose ofType as lettable operator ([#343](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/343)) ([fb4a5af](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/fb4a5af)), closes [#186](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/186)

* **typings:** TypeScript users: Added generics to createEpicMiddleware so developer defines what redux Actions look like ([#105](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/105)) ([7b4214f](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/7b4214f)). Previously, the behavior was rather restrictive so while it's unlikely going to break anyone's code, it technically is a breaking change.

### Features

* **Adapters:** Adds support for Epic input/output adapters. This allows us to support RxJS v4 via [redux-observable-adapter-rxjs-v4](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable-adapter-rxjs-v4) ([#85](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/85)) ([a662cdf](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/a662cdf))

### Features

* **replaceEpic:** Added middleware method to replace the root Epic. Useful for code splitting and hot reloading ([a8f458d](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/a8f458d))
* **replaceEpic:** Dispatches an EPIC_END action when you replaceEpic() ([#75](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/75)) ([fef6f80](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/fef6f80))

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) (2016-07-14)


### Bug Fixes

* **TypeScript type definition:** Add combineEpics(), provide more accurate type info for others ([#70](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/70)) ([20da88c](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/commit/20da88c)), closes [#69](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/69)



<a name="0.7.0"></a>
# 0.7.0 (2016-07-13)

We have brand new docs! http://redux-observable.js.org/

### BREAKING CHANGES

* thunkservables: We are deprecating thunkservables in favor of the new
process managers called "Epics". See
http://redux-observable.js.org/docs/FAQ.html#why-were-thunkservables-deprecated
for more information on Epics.
* API renames: Creating the middleware is now done with
`createEpicMiddleware(rootEpic)` instead of `reduxObservable(rootEpic)` and `combineDelegators()` has been renamed as
`combineEpics()`
* middleware: dispatched actions will now occur _before_ the actions created by synchronous observable side effects.
