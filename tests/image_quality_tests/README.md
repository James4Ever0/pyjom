# princlple

if the image quality is bad, then no matter what model we use we will get poor result.

# solution

use image quality assessment to examine ROI tracked by DasiamRPN and make sure we will use the best sample and get most accurate result.

# footnote

DasiamRPN is a good tracker. so before abandon the tracking data re-examine the ROI for several times to see if it really lost its mark. so as the siamMask.

You can also examine the image quality by means of motion. if it heavily moves, we refuse to feed it into model.

Integrate TA-Lib for less boilerplates. i mean financial analysis can be applied anywhere. they are basically statistics. anything other than that might just be fake.
