this library needs to be trained. also we need to replace this with the original 'levenshtein' based repeater bot.

warning: chatterbot use spacy. it may leads to OOM. better reserve its use for now. maybe the sentence bert based vector search is better than chatterbot. maybe you want to also replace this with the GPT based dialog bot.

i install chatterbot without dependencies.
