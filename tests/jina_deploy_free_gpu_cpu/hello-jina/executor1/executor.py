# remember our good old program? our shell?
# proper name is: reverse shell
# hackish? no?

# jina hub supports docker. no need for this shitty hackish shell...
# but we do not have a proper docker image! can we write docker file and push the image remotely, without local storage?

# All Executorsâ€™ uses must follow the format jinahub+docker://MyExecutor (from Jina Hub) to avoid any local file dependencies.
# what the heck?
# Each Executor is allowed a maximum of 4 GPUs, 16G RAM, 16 CPU cores & 10GB of block storage.
