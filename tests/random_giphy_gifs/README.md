giphy has many extensible apis. i guess most media platforms are all the same (complex enough), but we have to start somewhere though...

giphy has 'clips' now. clips are gifs with sound, just like short videos.

beta key limitations:

1000 requests per day, 42 requests per hour

or just use the public beta key? does that subject to the rate limit?
```javascript
var PUBLIC_BETA_API_KEY = 'dc6zaTOxFJmzC';
```

api keys:
